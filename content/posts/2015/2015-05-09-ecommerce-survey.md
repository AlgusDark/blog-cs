Dear survey participant,
Thank you for taking part in this small-scale survey on the shopping behaviour of online customers. 
My name is Julia and I am an MBA student at UTS Business School in Sydney, Australia. This survey is 
part of a research assignment for one of my subjects at university. The aim of the survey is to investigate 
the shopping behaviour and preferences of customers buying products online. The questions are designed 
to determine the reasons why you - as a customer - buy products online, which features are important 
to you, and where you see areas for improvement in existing online shops. Furthermore the study 
seeks to identify differences between users based on demographic variables such as nationality, gender, and age.

Your participation is anonymous and the information you provide will only be used for the purpose 
of the assignment. The questionnaire should not take more than 10 - 15 minutes to complete.
